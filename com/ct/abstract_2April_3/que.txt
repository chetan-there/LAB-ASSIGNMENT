Assignment :
-----------
Develop a scenario based program by using abstract class and abstract method for displaying different kinds of Products like Digital Product and 
Physical Product as well as discount and tax applicable on thses products

We need to develop one program on Hierarchical Inheritance, where Product is the super class and It has two sub classes DigitalProduct and PhysicalProduct.

Validate all the user inputs in constructor and where it is required.

Coding Requirements :
---------------------
Create one BLC class called Product.

Attributes/Properties/Fields :[Access Modifier private for all the fields]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
name : String
price : double 
category : String

Take a parameterized constructor to initialize all the fields.

Methods :

a) Method Name     : applyDiscount()
Argument           : One argument of type double [double percentage]
Return Type        : void
Access modifier    : public and abstract


b) Method Name     : calculateTax()
Argument           : No Argument
Return Type        : double
Access modifier    : public and abstract


c) Setter and getter for price variable.

d) Generate toString() method to print Object properties. 


Create another class DigitalProduct which extends from Product class.

Attributes/Properties/Fields :[Access Modifier private for all the fields]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
licenseKey : String

Take a parameterized constructor to initialize all the fields.

Methods :
a) Override applyDiscount(double percentage) method
   In this method find out the discount based on the given percentage on the product price.
   Discount percentage is 10 %
   Update the new price based on the given discount.
   Print both Discount and Updated Price.


b)Override calculateTax() method 
  In this method you should return 5% tax on the discounted price.

c) Generate toString() to print all the fields


Create another class PhysicalProduct which extends from Product class.

Attributes/Properties/Fields :[Access Modifier private for all the fields]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
shippingWeight : double

Take a parameterized constructor to initialize all the fields.

Methods :
a) Override applyDiscount(double percentage) method
   In this method find out the discount based on the given percentage on the product price.
   Discount percentage is 15 %
   Update the new price based on the given discount.
   Print both Discount and Updated Price.


b)Override calculateTax() method 
  In this method you should return 8% tax on the discounted price.

c)
Method Name        : calculateShippingCost()
Argument           : No argument
Return Type        : double
Access modifier    : public 
 
In this method you need to calculate and return shipping cost of the Physical Product. The defined shipping cost is 5 RS per KG.

d) Generate toString() to print all the fields

Create an ELC class called ProductStore.

Inside main method display the following details as a Menu.
Select Product Type:
1. Digital Product
2. Physical Product

Write Switch case with Scanner class to select Digital OR Physical Product

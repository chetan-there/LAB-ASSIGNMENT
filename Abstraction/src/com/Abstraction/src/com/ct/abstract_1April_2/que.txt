Assignment 02 :
---------------
creating a Java program to model different animal romes using abstract classes and subclasses. Follow the instructions below to complete the program:

Start by defining an abstract class called Animal with an abstract method:

roam(): This method should represent the roaming style of Animal.
Create a subclass named Lion that extends the Animal class. Implement the roam() method to print:
"Lion is roaming"

Create another subclass named Dog that also extends the Animal class. Implement the roam() method to print:
"Dog is roaming"

In the ELC, Main class, write a main method to accomplish the following by using upcasting.

Create an instance of the Lion class.
Call the roam() method on the lion instance.
Create an instance of the Dog class.
Call the roam() method on the Dog instance.
Ensure that your program output displays the unique roaming style of both the lion and the dog.

After Execution add the following Methdos in the sub classes :

Lion class :
-------------
public void roar() : Add this method in the Lion class to show the roaring behavior of Lion

Dog class :
-----------
public void bark() : Add this method in Dog class to show the barking behavior of Dog class

Take another static method in the ELC class
Method name : getAnimal()
return type : void
Parameter type : Animal
Modifiers : public, static

In the body of getAnimal() method, call both the methods of Lion and Dog class.

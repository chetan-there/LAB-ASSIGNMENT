Assignment 01:
--------------
Define an abstract class 'Shape' with following specifications
Methods:
1. Name: getArea
   ReturnType: double
   Modifier: abstract
2. Name: printDetails
    ReturnType: double
    Modifier: abstract
Define sub-classes of Shape as Rectangle, Circle and Triangle that overrides the methods of Shape class
Rectangle class
Fields:
	1. length - double
	2. breadth - double
Constructors:
	A parametrized constructor the accepts and initializes length and breadth.
Circle class
Fields:
	1. radius - double
Constructors:
	A parametrized constructor the accepts and initializes radius.
Triangle class
Fields:
	1. base - double
	2. height - double
Constructors:
	A parametrized constructor the accepts and initializes base and height.
All the sub-classes of Shape should override the methods of the shape.
getArea() should return the area of the respective shape.
printDetails() should print the shape details as below
	input:  Rectangle(30.3, 45.4)
	output:
		Type = Rectangle
		Length = 30.3
		Breadth = 45.4
		Area = 1375.62
	input: Circle(23.2)
	output:
		Type = Circle
		Radius = 23.2
		Area = 1690.0736
	input: Triangle(146.2, 40.0);
	output:
		Type = Triangle
		Base = 146.2
		Height = 40.0
		Area = 2924.0
Given a class Testing with main method to test your code.

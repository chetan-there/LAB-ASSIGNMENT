Assignment 01 :
----------------
Develop a program by using ITC to implement the Car Parking System.Here in the parking area we have MAX_SPOTS. A car can only park in the parking area if the available spot is free otherwise car has to wait for another car to vacant the 
parking spot.

Coding Requirements :
----------------------
Create a BLC class called ParkingGarage

Fields/Attributes/Properties [private access modifier] :
--------------------------------------------------------

       availableSpots : int
       MAX_SPOTS final : int

 Take a parameter constructor which accept one parameter maxSpots to initialize both the non static field.   

Methods :
---------    
    1) Method Name 		: parkCar()
       Parameter   		: carName of type String
       Return Type 		: void
       Access modifier		: public
       Modifier			: synchronized
       In this method Car thread will verify whether parking spot is available or not, If not available then Car thread has to wait, If available car will be parked in the available spot and 1 spot will be decreased from the available spot. [see the Test cases for Output]

    
    2) Method Name 		: freeSpot()
       Parameter   		: carName of type String
       Return Type 		: void
       Access modifier		: public
       Modifier			: synchronized
       In this method Car thread will verify at-least one car is parked in the parking area or not, If not then the thread has to wait for making a spot free, On the other hand if cars are already parked in the parking 
       area then car will leave the spot ONE BY ONE and it will increase the 
       available spot in the parking area.[see the Test cases for Output]

    3) Create a getter method for the non static field availableSpots.

Take another BLC class called Car which implements from Runnable interface.

Fields/Attributes/Properties [private access modifier] :
--------------------------------------------------------
   garage  : ParkingGarage
   carName : String

Take a Parameterized constructor to initialize all the fields.

Override the run() method.In this run() method perform the following task
 a) Park the car in the Parking area. [See the Test cases]
 b) The car will be parked there for some time, The time is not fixed so you 
    need to take a Ranom time.
 c) The car leaves parking spot after staying parked for a while.
 d) Interrupt the thread in the catch block.

Create an ELC class CarParkingProject with main method.Implement the project in the main method.

Test cases for Output [Will change Dynamically]

Assignment 02 :
---------------
Objective:
Design a COVID-19 vaccine booking application that allows users to check their eligibility based on age and health conditions. Users who meet the eligibility criteria can book a dose, and the application should handle concurrent user interactions using threads.

Instructions:

1.Implement the VaccineEligibility class with the following properties :

-> private int age: The age of the user.

-> private boolean hasHealthCondition: A boolean indicating whether the user has a health condition.

-> Implement a constructor that takes age and health condition as parameters and initializes the class properties.

-> Implement the isEligible() method within the VaccineEligibility class to check if a user is eligible for the vaccine. A user is eligible if their age is 18 years or above and either their age is less than 60 years or they have a health condition.



2. Implement the DoseBooking class with the following property:



-> private boolean booked: A boolean indicating whether the user has booked a dose.

-> Implement bookDose() within the DoseBooking class to book a dose. If the dose is already booked, throw a RuntimeException with the message "Dose already booked."

-> Implement isDoseBooked() within the DoseBooking class to check if the user has booked a dose.



3.Define the User class with the following properties:



-> private String name: The name of the user.

-> private VaccineEligibility eligibility: An instance of the VaccineEligibility class to check the user's eligibility.

->  private DoseBooking doseBooking: An instance of the DoseBooking class to manage dose booking for the user.

-> Implement a constructor that takes the user's name, age, and health condition as parameters and initializes the class properties.



-> Implement the isEligible() method within the User class to check if the user is eligible for the vaccine by using the isEligible() method of the VaccineEligibility class.

-> Implement the bookDose() method within the User class to book a dose for the user if they are eligible. If the user is not eligible, throw a RuntimeException with the message "You are not eligible for the vaccine."

-> Implement the isDoseBooked() method within the User class to check if the user has already booked a dose by using the isDoseBooked() method of the DoseBooking class.



4. In the CoronaVaccineApp class:



-> Create two User objects: user1 and user2.

-> Simulate concurrent user interactions using threads by creating two threads (thread1 and thread2) with anonymous runnable instances representing the user interactions.



Sample Output:

Dose booked successfully for Ramesh

Suresh is not eligible for the vaccine.

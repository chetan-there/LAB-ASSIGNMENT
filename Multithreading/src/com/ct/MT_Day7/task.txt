Order Delivery System in a Restaurant.

The scenario is :
A Restaurant waiter will place the food to order to chef and waiting for
food preparation.
A Restaurant chef will prepare the food and notify the waiter after
preparation.

## Coding Requirements:

Create a BLC class called Restaurant.

## Fields/Attributes/Properties \[private access modifier]

name\:String
order\:String
boolean isOrderReady = false; //\[Initial Order Status]

Take a paraneterized constructor to initialize the Restaurant name.

## Methods :

```
1) Method Name 		: placeOrder()
   Parameter   		: order of type STring
   Return Type 		: void
   Access modifier		: public
   Modifier			: synchronized

In this method chef will prepare the food.It will take some time
based on food. After food preparation, It will notify to the waiter
so waiter can server the food.

```
3) Create a getter method getRestaurantName() to get the name of the 
   Restaurant.
```

Take another BLC class called Waiter which extends from Thread

## Fields/Attributes/Properties \[private access modifier]

restaurant Restaurant
orderName  String

Take a parameterized constructor to initialize the restaurant property.

   In this method take the order from the customer and initialize non static variable.
```

2\) Override the run method, inside this run method place the customer oder
in the Restaurant for preparation.

Take another BLC class called Chef which extends from Thread

## Fields/Attributes/Properties \[private access modifier]

restaurant Restaurant

Take a parameterized constructor to initialize the restaurant property.

## Methods :

1. Override the run method, inside this run method prepare the customer oder
